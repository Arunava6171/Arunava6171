###Hi, I'm Arunava Biswas.
I'm a passionate Software Developer focused on building scalable and efficient software systems from the ground up.

I recently put my passion for data and machine learning into practice by developing a Spam Mail Prediction System. Leveraging Python, ML, and TF-IDF, I engineered a model that achieved an impressive 95% prediction accuracy. This project sharpened my ability to deliver high-performance, real-world solutions.

My technical foundation is built on core concepts like DBMS, OS, CN, and OOPs. I thrive on tackling complex problems with clean, well-structured code, and I'm always eager to collaborate and learn in a growth-oriented environment.
